                      At the age of 13 he obtained his first drums, which he played for years before buying and playing records. In 1990, when the Italian House scene was in its golden age - along with the Acid House craze in Britain - Carola's drums were replaced by two turntables and a mixer. He practiced a lot with the table and quickly learned to play the new rhythms that were heard on the dance floors.
                   Carola's transition to techno began in 1993 with other Neapolitan friends and clubbers such as Gaetano Parisio, Davide Squillace, Random Noize and other DJs who were looking to do something new on the Neapolitan scene. With the golden age of the Italo-House coming to an end, techno offered new possibilities for experimentation with all those new sounds that Marco and his friends loved. At that time Marco also began to think about creating his own studio to express his own vision of techno. His ability to mix music and his talent in the field of production led many artists to visit his studio to record. In addition to various House tracks.</p>

                <p>Loco Dice, born in Tunisia as Yassine Ben Achour, is a German dj and producer endowed with enough empathy to hypnotize audiences and make them fly thanks to his sessions. He began his career as a hip hop dj, until he discovered the techno and house scene and began his meteoric career. It was then that he arrived on the island and positioned himself as a resident of DC10. In 2008 he recorded his first album for Desolat, a label that he created with Martin Buttrich, entitled ‘7 Dunham Place’.
               His world fame, especially in Germany and the United Kingdom, and his sexy and pleasant style allowed him to get to have a residence in one of the coolest clubs in the world: DC-10, in Ibiza, and in the favorite place of Germany: Tribehouse, in his native Düsseldorf.
                Loco Dice toured South America, the United States and Europe and played venues such as Crobar, Creamfields, Pacha and Fiebre Versilia, in Italy. He did it also in raves and beaches. And he even became a presenter for the music channel MTV.</p>

                <p>Luciano was born in Montcherand, Switzerland to a Swiss father and Chilean mother. His father was a jukebox repairman with a large record collection that was played at home.While part of his childhood was spent in Switzerland, musically it would not be as influential as the Chilean and Latin American sounds he would experience upon moving to Santiago, Chile at the age of eleven. His mother along with his sister relocated there after his parents' divorce.
    When he was twelve years old, his mother bought him a guitar, which was when Luciano's involvement with music began. He was the guitar player in a punk rock band at school until the age of sixteen. Not long after, he learned that electronic instruments such as sequencers and drum machines were replacing analog ones. After finding a French band called Bérurier Noir that used drum machines in place of a drum set, his passion and interest in electronic music commenced.
               Luciano and his wife have 3 sons and a daughter. In 2007, Luciano moved from Berlin a Swiss village near Geneva to spend more time with them. Luciano enjoys gardening, nature and being surrounded by it. At the beginning of his career, his handlebar moustache was his signature image.</p>

                <p>Padley entered the electronic music scene at a young age, beginning to frequent area nightclubs at the age of 14.His DJ education started at 17, playing 12–13-hour sets each Sunday at a club in his hometown (under his birth name). His residency soon became a top afterparty destination for clubbers in the area. As word got around, Padley's notoriety increased, resulting in a 2006 residency at Cream Ibiza in Amnesia under the banner of Leeds club Glasshouse.
            In 2010, Padley was attending an Ibiza afterparty when the music suddenly cut out. He plugged his iPhone into the party's speakers, and incidentally, one of his works-in-progress came on. Though Padley had admittedly not made the track with the intent of releasing it, reactions at the party were roundly positive, causing him to contact his friend Danish DJ / Producer Noir, who runs the record label Noir Recordings. Noir was impressed, and released it on his label. 'Let It Ride' came out on Noir Music on September 5, 2011, hitting number three on Beatport's deep house chart. Thus, Hot Since 82 was born.Rising out of obscurity, Daley has recently been featured in a variety of widely popular electronic music . </p>
